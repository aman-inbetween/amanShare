
	//1. 2009: Created at google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson and launched as an open-source programming language.
	//2. Goals of the Go project were to eliminate the slowness and clumsiness of software development at Google.
	//3. The language was designed by and for people who write and read and debug and maintain large software systems.
	//4. Based on the best features from C, Pascal, and Oberon programming languages.
	//5. 2015, The most significant release Golang 1.5 was presented.
	//   - The compiler toolchain has been converted from C to Go entirely in this release.
	//6. Big companies like Alibaba, Cloudflare, Docker, IBM, Firefox, BCC, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc., use Golang
	//7. Dropbox (over 500 million users) decided to migrate the performance-critical back-ends features from Python to GoLang.
	//8. Platform targeted executable - build by setting the arguments 'GOOS' and 'GOARCH'


	//1. Strong and statically typed
	//2. Garbage collection
	//3. Compiles to standalone binary(ur code + all external libs + go run time) = > resulting in one executable
	//4. Fast compile time





Some problems with existing languages:
c/C++:
- Complex type system,
- longer compile times

Python:
- Interpreted, difficult to build huge enterprise level solutions




----------------------------------------------------------
Go:
- Fast compile time
- Garbage collected, BuiltIn
- concurrency in built, no external libraries required
- compiles to standalone binaries, no additional dependencies required at runtime
- Targeted at building web applications

----------------------------------------------------------
Execution entryPoint:
main function in the main package

----------------------------------------------------------
Installation
> Donwload and install msi
> setup Go workspace and Env variables
> create a workspace anywhere on the system
  - D:\gocode\myProj1\src
  - D:\gocode\myProj1\bin
  - D:\gocode\myProj1\pkj
>Add the path to the workspace in env variables
----------------------------------------------------------
Starting to code
1. Go to the workspace > project > src
2. Open Command prompt

>go version  //check version and installation

> go env     //Check env variables, especially the value of GOPATH(should be your workspace)

We can set following platorm specifc variables to generate executable for that platform(auto set if installed using go windows installer)
> set GOOS=windows
> set GOARCH=amd64

----------------------------------------------------------
compile and run
To run directly on command line
> go run <filename>.go

Build executable
> go build <filename>.go  //this will generate an executable with <filename>.executable
